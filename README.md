The Meme Generator
=====================

Welcome to the Meme Generator. Ever wonder where all of those
internet memes come from? Well not from here, but now you to
can share your sense of humor with the online world by turning 
photos into memes. With your own creativity and the click of a
button you have a meme that can be copied and shared.

Is it hard to do, and do I need an account or something?
---------------------------------------------------------

Well the answer to those questions are no and no. This project was 
built as a personal learning experience for me to dive into using 
REACT and Redux, and more importantly for just plain fun. So please 
meme away.

Functionality
==============

The Meme Generator was built to be simple and fun, and in my
opinion, nothing allows you to do this easier than using REACT.
However I have to give a huge shoutout for the free version of 
imgflip.com API. This API allows access to a free database of 
hundreds of images just awaiting to be memeafied (yes I made that
word up). To use, simply add your own text to one or both of the 
input boxes at the top of the page. The input boxes are labeled 
top and bottom to specify where you want the meme text to appear.

===============================================================================

After you have decided on what the funniest text ever would be, click 
on the photo that you want to memefy (another made up word, sorry), 
and it will create your new meme above the text input boxes.

Technical Specs
===============

The Meme Generator was made using several
front-end web technologies including:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- JSX
- REACT
- Redux
- ES6
- imgflip.com API


Future functionality?
===========================

Well, probably not. I always think things can be improved, 
but as mentioned before this was built as a learning experience
and mostly for fun. However I am always open to feedback and 
suggestions. So please get in touch if you have any ideas.
